# Universalis shaders
A minecraft shaderpack.

This shaderpack is 100% AMD compatible because i use a Radeon RX 580 to developp it. 

## Features:
-Dynamic shadows

-Global Illumination (Reflective shadow map)

-Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (alchemy AO)

-Screen-Space reflections

-Shadow-Space reflections (to reflect some off-screen objects)

-Support for the labPBR specular format

-Normal mapping

-Parallax Mapping

-Parallax shadows

-Volumetric Fog

-Volumetric Water

-Depth of Field

-Temporal antialiasing (TAA)

-HDR framebuffers

-Volumertic clouds with shadows

-Rain puddles

-and probably more, i don't remember everything

## Disclaimer:
This shaderpack is far from being a finished product, it's a personnal project i'm working on because i love graphic programming. If you find new issues, feel free to report them, but i can't guarantee i'm going to fix it.

Due to poor optimisations, i recommand using a high end GPU to run this shaderpack (GTX 1070/RX Vega 56) , or you might have to lower the resolution to get acceptable framerates.

## Thanks:
Thanks to Inigo Quilez (Iq) and all the shadertoy community for making me addicted to Shaders and graphics programming.

Thanks to Daxnitro, Karyonix and Sp64x for creating, maintaining, and improving the shader mod and Optifine over the years.

Thanks to all the folks at the shaderLabs Discord server for inspiring me and motivating me to keep this project alive.

And thanks to the 5 people who tried my shaderpack who made me keep going with this mess.
